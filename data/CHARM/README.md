## ‚ú®CHARM
**CHARM** is the first benchmark for comprehensively and in-depth evaluating the commonsense reasoning ability of large language models (LLMs) in Chinese, which covers both globally known and Chinese-specific commonsense. In addition, the CHARM can evaluate the LLMs' memorization-independent reasoning abilities and analyze the typical errors.


### üìñ Commonsense Domain
#### üåê Global commonsense domain
Global commonsense domain consists of universally understood commonsense.
It covers objects and aspects of modern life that an individual should be aware of.
It includes foundational knowledge that someone with a basic modern education is expected to know.  When it involves individuals, they are globally recognized figures.

#### üö© Chinese commonsense domain
Chinese commonsense domain encompasses Chinese-specific elements. We categoried them into 7 aspects:
- **History (H)** includes important events and figures in Chinese history, China's dynasties, and other basic  facts and shared knowledge about the history of China.

- **Traditional Culture and Arts (CA)** encompasses Chinese traditional cultural arts, literary works, and traditional lifestyles.

- **Daily Life and Customs (LC)** includes modern Chinese daily routines, clothing, food, housing, transportation festivals and so on.

- **Entertainment (E)** includes the movies, television programs, music, and other entertainments in modern Chinese daily life.
- **Public Figures (F)** encompasses the public figures well-known in Chinese society.
- **Geography (G)** includes China's geographical distribution, natural landscapes, and characteristic regional cultures.

- **Chinese Language (L)** includes the fundamentals of the Chinese language, such as Chinese characters, idioms and so on.

### üìã Task List

- **Reasoning Tasks :** The charm consists of 7 reasoning tasks, which are: **Anachronisms Judgment (AJ), Time Understanding (TU), Sequence Understanding (SqU), Movie and Music Recommendation (MMR), Sport Understanding (SpU), Natural Language Inference (NLI), Reading Comprehension (RC).**

- **Memorization Tasks:** We chose that can be readily associated in this manner, **AJ, TU, MMR, SpU,** refered as the Memorization-Reasoning-Interconnected (MRI) tasks, and built
the reltated memorization questions.

## Translation

All files, including `reasoning`, `memorization` and `few-shot-examples`, have been translated into English using the [DeepL API](https://www.deepl.com/api.html). Please note that translations of topics involving traditional Chinese poetry, idioms, movie names, etc., done via the API may have inaccuracies. The translated English files are only for the convenience of displaying to people who are not native Chinese speaker. The original Chinese questions should be referred to for accurate understanding.
